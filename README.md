Attention: Stemma QT - Interface is [NOT working with current Micropython Version](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/9372), due to throwing an error on GPIO 20! As I2C can be used with any standard GPIO-Pins, just use normal pins for now and solder both the light and the humidity sensor directly to the board
